# Kate Schaefer Portfolio Site

The first professional portfolio site I created for myself was back in 2018 when I was fresh out of a coding bootcamp and just getting into the job market. That site was neglected for the past few years and now, in 2023, I'm starting from scratch and updating the content.

I chose to give [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) a whirl as well as [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), two technologies new to me, in addition to [react](https://reactjs.org/), n trusted old favorite.

The site is currently under construction but will be available soon in it's beta form (basic content) soon with hopes to continue to add additional content and iterate throughout the coming year.
