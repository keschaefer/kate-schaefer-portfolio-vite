          Hello! I am a front-end focused developer who specializes in writing
          web applications in React and TypeScript with all the assorted fixings
          of the Javascript ecosystem. I came to software development via a
          string of varied careers including most recently, non-profit
          fundraising work and museum-centric jobs. Itâ€™s been a winding path
          with each experience along the way providing insights and skills for
          how to work best on any team, including of course, a team that writes
          software.
        </p>
      </div>
    </SectionWrapper>
