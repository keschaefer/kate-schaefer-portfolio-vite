          Hello! I'm Kate, a front-end focused developer who specializes in
          writing web applications in React and TypeScript with all the assorted
          fixings of the Javascript ecosystem. I came to software development
          via a string of varied careers including most recently, non-profit
          fundraising work and museum-centric jobs. Itâ€™s been a winding path
          with each experience along the way providing insights and skills for
          how to work best on any team, including of course, a team that writes
          software.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4">
          I love working on projects that visualize data, particularly
          geospatial data. There is something deeply satisfying about taking
          table of data and voila, seeing it rendered orderly on a map.
        </p>
